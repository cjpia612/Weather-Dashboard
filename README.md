# Weather-Dashboard
Weather dashboard utilizing OpenWeather API
## Launch

On the page, enter your desired city in the Search input and click Search. This will show the current weather data, including the UV Index and a 5 day forecast. 

## Challenges

Past city storage is prepended to the page properly, however after the page is refreshed and a new city is added, it replaces the old city data. 
The prepended list is also not clickable. 

## Acknowledgment
As always, big shout out to the homework crew, Carmen Obied, Zach Corpuz, and Alek Valencia. Glitches galore.
