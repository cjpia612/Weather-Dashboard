# Weather-Dashboard
Weather dashboard utilizing OpenWeather API
## Launch

On the page, enter your desired city in the Search input and click Search. This will show the current weather data, including the UV Index and a 5 day forecast. 

## Challenges

Past city storage is prepended to the page properly, however after the page is refreshed and a new city is added, it replaces the old city data. 
The prepended list is also not clickable. 
Although other icons are all visible, the current weather icon does not show despite being called in the same way. 

## Acknowledgment
As always, big shout out to the homework crew, Carmen Obied, Zach Corpuz, and Alek Valencia. Glitches galore.
